                couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your<br>

                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing<br>
                    weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a<br>
