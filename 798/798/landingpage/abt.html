    <h2>What is the Mock Trial Club?</h2>
    <p>College of Charlestonâ€™s Mock Trial Club is a student-led, student-run organization that focuses on the procedures and various practices of law. We hope to fill gaps in the existing curriculum regarding lawful practices and deliberation, all while preparing members for real-world scenarios and allowing for sharing of experiences and local expertise.</p>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Our club meets each week in order to develop our skills, knowledge and understanding of the many different aspects of law, ranging from simpler topics such as civil procedure and judicial functions to more complex topics such as criminal procedure, direct and cross examinations, input of evidence, and extensive trial procedure. We hope by covering a wide range of topics within the field of law we can cultivate the skills of our members who are all considering applying to law school and are dedicated to learning all the ins and outs of the procedural system.
<br>
    We will meet in the <b>Stern Center in room 409 on Fridays at 7PM</b> for the Spring 2022 semester.</p>
<h2>The Debate Team</h2>
<p>An important part of our club is the Debate Team. The CofC Mock Trial Debate Team competes in several competitions each year. Because this club is recently founded, we have not had the chance to enroll our members to compete in the National Mock Trial competitions, but our administrative team is working on the paperwork to be able to do this.
<br>
    Competing in these competitions provides extremely valuable experience that is recognized in the industry. Many of our members have competed in high school, and can attribute job offers, interviews, and experience they have received directly to their participation in these competitions.
    <br>
    Anyone, regardless of experience, is encouraged to participate!</p>
