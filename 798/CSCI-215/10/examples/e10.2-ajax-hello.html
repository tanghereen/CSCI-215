    Use AJAX to call e10.2-hello.php e10.2-world.php and load the results in the DOM.

    This example illustrates a technique of sending multiple ajax requests in parallel via the common loadAjax() method
    and providing different callback methods to process the different responses.

    In both cases the content from the remote resource is simply displayed to the user without modification.
