    This assignment is individual work only!

    I certify that I have written this code myself. Nobody else has written it for me. I have not copied and
    pasted it from somebody else. I have solved these problems myself using the materials used in class.

    If I am found guilty of breaking these rules or conducting other dishonest actions while working on this
    assignment, I understand that I will receive a score of 0 for this assignment, and that the instructor may
    report my dishonesty for a conduct review by the Dean of Student Affairs which could result in an F in
    this course.

    I acknowledge the above rules of this assignment.
